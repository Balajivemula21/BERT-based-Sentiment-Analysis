## BERT-based-Sentiment-Analysis
"Accurate sentiment detection with BERT"

# Introduction

Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding emotional expressions and opinions in text. Telugu, with over 85 million native speakers globally, lacks robust sentiment analysis tools, Our work bridges this gap by leveraging advanced deep-learning techniques. Sentiment analysis helps in understanding public opinion and sentiment towards various topics, In the context of news articles, sentiment analysis aids in understanding reader reactions and perceptions.

# Model Architecture

This conceptual foundation utilizes BERT and mBERT for accurate translation enhancement. The process involves fine-tuning the pre-trained models, adjusting hyperparameters, and optimizing for language diversity. 

1. "BERT Utilization for Telugu Language Modeling":
Employ BERT architecture for language modeling in Telugu. Leverage BERT's bidirectional context understanding to capture nuanced semantics and syntax.

2. "Integration of POS and NER Algorithms":
Incorporate POS tagging for identifying grammatical components.Utilize NER algorithms to recognize named entities, enhancing semantic comprehension.

3. "Focus on Enhancing Sentiment Analysis Models":
Fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis tasks, prioritizing accuracy, precision, and recall improvements. Utilize annotated datasets for model training and validation.

4. "Advancement of Telugu NLP Capabilities":
Contribute to improved NLP capabilities tailored for Telugu. Address unique linguistic nuances and challenges in Telugu text.

5. "Performance Evaluation on Diverse Telugu Datasets":
Assess model proficiency on varied Telugu datasets, including TSAD. Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for comprehensive evaluation.
